          is the superhero protector of Gotham City, a tortured, brooding
          vigilante dressed as a sort of human bat who fights against evil and
          strikes fear into the hearts of criminals everywhere. In his public
          identity he is <b>Bruce Wayne</b>, billionaire industrialist and
          notorious playboy. Although he has no superhuman abilities, he is one
          of the world's smartest men and greatest fighters. His physical
          prowess, technical ingenuity, and tactical thinking make him an
          incredibly dangerous opponent. He is also a founding member of the

          A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne’s double life affords him
          the comfort of a life without financial worry, a loyal
          butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the
          ancient network of caves beneath his family’s sprawling estate. By
          night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape
          and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops
          of Gotham City.
